# Dogs in the Workplace

A common sense guide for employees who occasionally wish to bring their dogs to work with them.

## Guidelines

- Owner is personally responsible for their dog and its actions.
- Owner must be mindful of coworkers and office visitors:
	- Give sensitive individuals reasonable space and/or the opportunity to approach a dog on their own terms. Sensitivities may include allergies, fear of dogs, desire to work without interruptions, etc.
- Owner will provide their dog with a place to rest, fresh water, and a quiet toy/chew.
- Owner will keep the dog contained during times that their office door or workspace is open (e.g. baby gate, portable exercise pen, crate).
- Owner will keep their dog on a short, fixed-length leash while moving about the building.
- Owner may not leave their dog unsupervised.
- Owner will clean up after their dog in a timely manner.
- Owner may socialize their dog with willing coworkers. However, owner and dog may not actively fraternize with non-employee office visitors.
- Dog must be spayed or neutered, and be at least 6 months of age.
- Dog must be current with its vaccinations including canine distemper and rabies.
- Dog must be calm, even-tempered and predictable. Disruptive behaviour will not be tolerated (e.g. excessive barking, destructiveness, aggression, fearfulness, marking).
- Dog must be clean, well-groomed, parasite-free and in good general health.
- Owners are encouraged to coordinate visits amongst themselves to ensure that:
	- too many dogs are not present at the same time.
	- incompatible dogs are kept apart.
- It is recommended that owner and dog complete a basic obedience course or achieve CKC Canine Good Neighbour certification.

## Suggestion

- To alert others when a dog is present, owners may wish to post a notice on their office door or at the entrance of their work area: Consider displaying a photo with the dog's name, breed and age.

## Exceptions

- The preceding guidelines are intended for employees and their pets only. These guidelines do not apply to:
	- registered service animals and their handlers.
	- handler and dog teams visiting the premises as part of a certified therapy animal program (e.g. Therapeutic Paws of Canada, Saint John Ambulance).
	- patrons and the general public.
